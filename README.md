General
-------

Moderation Alerts Pack is an extension made for euantor's [MyAlerts][1] plugin with the aim to add more alerts and events to be notified of.

If you have any feature request, suggestion, or you want to report any issue, please let me know opening a new issue on GitHub. Your contribute is very important to me and helps me into making Moderation Alerts Pack more complete on every commit. 

Main features
-------------

At the moment, MyAlerts Moderation Alerts Pack comes with **14 additional alerts**, but I've planned to add even more throughout the years. Its settings are safely added to existing MyAlerts settings group and updated consequently: you can obviously turn on and off them as you would do with the standard 5 alerts. You can be notified:

* When someone edits your posts
* When someone deletes your posts
* When someone deletes your threads
* When someone opens your threads
* When someone closes your threads
* When someone moves your threads in another Forum
* When someone warns you
* When someone revokes you an active warning
* When someone suspends/unsuspends you from posting
* When someone sets/unsets your posts to be moderated
* When someone suspends/unsuspends your signature
* When someone edits your username
* When someone edits your signature
* When someone approves/unapproves your threads
